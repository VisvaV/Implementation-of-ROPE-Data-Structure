# Rope Data Structure  

## Overview  
The **ROPE** data structure is an efficient way to store and manipulate long strings using a binary tree-like structure. It supports fast operations like splitting, concatenating, inserting, and deleting substrings.  

## Features  
- Split a rope at a given index into two ropes.  
- Concatenate another rope to the current rope.  
- Insert a string at a given index.  
- Delete a character at a given index.  
- Display the contents of the rope.  

## Compilation and Execution  
To compile the program, use a C++ compiler like G++ or Clang. After compilation, run the generated executable to start the program.  

## Usage  
The program provides a menu-driven interface where the user can choose from various operations:  

1. Split - Splits the rope into two at a given index.  
2. Concat - Concatenates another string to the rope.  
3. Insert - Inserts a string at a specified index.  
4. Delete - Deletes a character at a given index.  
5. Display - Displays the current rope.  
6. Exit - Terminates the program.  

## Example Interaction  
ROPE DATA STRUCTURE MENU  
1. Split  
2. Concat  
3. Insert  
4. Delete  
5. Display  
6. Exit  
Enter choice: 3  
Enter index: 2  
Enter string: Hello  
New Rope: Hello
